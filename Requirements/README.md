# ANTI-LOCK BRAKING SYSTEM

## Introduction

ABS brake pressure in such a way that the wheels do not lock when you brake. This allows you to continue steering the vehicle when braking.
ABS helping you maintain directional control.

### Components

The four major components of a typical anti-lock braking system are:
- Speed sensors - These sensors monitor how fast the wheel or wheels are rotating
- Valves - Valves in the brake line allow, block and release pressure on the brakes by assuming three different positions
- Pump - These pumps are filled with hydraulic fluid and apply pressure to the brake drums or calipers on demand
- Controller - The electronic control unit (ECU) is the brain of the ABS and uses data from the sensors to determine whether or not to pump the brakes

## REQUIREMENTS

|ID | Description |
|----|----------------|
SYS_1 | If a slight brake is applied, the wheels tend to slip, then the ABS provides grip to the wheels |
SYS_2 | If a sudden full brake is applied in heavy braking situations, the ABS should stop the wheels at a shorter distance to avoid any clashes |
SYS_3 | If vehicles are moving on slippery surfaces like snow, ice, watery, oily, there is less grip when brake is applied on the wheels, the ABS should detect the locking of a wheel and attempt to stop any skidding or locking from occurring |
SYS_4 | If a vehicle is applying brakes while moving on two different surfaces(slippery and non-slippery), then the ABS should provide stability to the vehicle to stop |
SYS_5 | If there are crosswinds, the heavy good vehicles face issues driving in strong crosswinds, here using ABS to apply the brakes to wheels and help keep lorries on the straight and narrow |
SYS_6 | If any fault occurs in the ABS Control system, it should be indicated by the illumination of the ABS warning indicator in the dashboard |
